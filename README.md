Hero Wars Dungeons compendium

General rules and goals:
- Generally, in each titan fight, there are two goals
  - start the fight with titans pumped with maximum energy
  - finish each fight with maximum titans with fully pumped energy
- Use divination cards only for hero fights
- Never use the last card (I'm usually ot using the last three cards) because as long as you have one card before titan fights, you have access to estimations about how the fight may end up in auto mode. If you can in manual mode and end with a higher level of energy and health, this means that you increase the chance of doing the exact day more dungeon levels
- Each won titan fight increases by one level one of the enemy team titans. So the more fights, the more difficult it is to win
- If, on choosing one of the two types of fights, you are taking the exact type of fight more often than on doing the next try, you will have a higher probability that it will be more difficult to win that type of fight. Try to keep in mind the frequency of different types of fights to keep all types in healthy balance according to the power of your titan types (I know that the best would be to have only water fights üòÅ)
