Hero Wars Dungeons compendium

General rules and goals:
- Generally, in each titan fight, there are two goals
  - start the fight with titans pumped with maximum energy
  - finish each fight with maximum titans with fully pumped energy
- Use divination cards only for hero fights
- Never use the last card (I'm usually not using the last three cards) because as long as you have one card before the titans fight, you have access to estimations about how the fight may end up in auto mode. If you can finish in manual mode with a higher level of energy and/or health than in that estimation, it means that you increased the chance of doing the exact day more dungeon levels
- Each won titan fight increases by one level one of the enemy team titans. So, the more fights, the more difficult it is to win
- If, on choosing one of the two types of fights, you are taking the exact type of titan fight more often than on doing the next try, you will have a bit higher difficulty of winning the exact type of titan fights. Try to keep in mind the frequency of different types of fights to keep all types of fights in healthy balance according to the power of your titan types (I know .. the best would be to have only water titan fights 😁)

Titans fight by types:

- Earth
  
- Fire
  
- *Watter*

  Always fight with all four water titans. If Siguard has almost no energy and/or no health, remove Siguard from the team (especially if in the enemy team front line is Moloch) and wait until the next fight in the front line will be Vulcan or to heal Siguard in the next mixed fight.
  - Scenarios:
    - The fight starts with all 4 titans full of energy

      Trigger first (manually) Hyperion → wait until enemy Moloch will have his hammer in the highest position or Vulcan will stop walking and will start raising his cannon to trigger Siguard shield → watch Siguard white bar with his shield timer → trigger Nova and Mairi (press auto) just before Siguard timer wil be depeted → wait until watter totem will trigger to disable auto which should kill Moloch/Vulcan → if it is possible do not trigger any other titans and accept small damages at the end of the fight to finish with all/almost all titans full of energy. Finishing with full energy has a higher priority than with higher health.
